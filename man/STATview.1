.TH STATVIEW "1" "SEPTEMBER 2008" "STATview" "The Stack Trace Analysis Tool Viewer"

.SH NAME
STATview \- invokes the Stack Trace Analysis Tool graph viewer

.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
\fBSTATview\fR \fB[\fR\fISTAT_generated_graph.dot\fR\fB]\fR where:
.TP
\fISTAT_generated_graph.dot\fR
is a .dot file generated by STAT

.SH DESCRIPTION
STATview is a GUI for viewing STAT outputted DOT files.  STATview provides easy navigation of the call prefix tree and also allows manipulation of the call tree to help focus on areas of interest.  Each node in the STAT call prefix tree represents a function call and the directed edges denote the calling sequence.  Further, the edges are labeled by the set of tasks that have taken that call path.  For simplification, STATview will display the number of tasks in the set and truncate long task lists in the main display with "..." notation.  Nodes are colored based on the set of tasks of the incoming edge, providing a visual distinction when different tasks take different branches.

By clicking on a node in the call prefix tree you will get a window displaying the full list of tasks.  This window also contains buttons that allow for the manipulation of the graph from that node.  Note these operations are performed on the current visible state of the call prefix tree.  Here is a list of operations and their definitions:
.TP
\fBCollapse\fR
Hide all of the descendants of the clicked node
.TP
\fBCollapse Depth\fR
Hide all nodes with a depth greater than the clicked node
.TP
\fBHide\fR
Hide all of the descendants of the clicked node and the clicked node itself
.TP
\fBExpand\fR
Show the children of the clicked node
.TP
\fBExpand All\fR
Show all of the descendants of the clicked node
.TP
\fBFocus\fR
Show only the ancestors and the descendants of the clicked node
.TP

Along the top of the main display are additional operations.  Most of these commands operate on the current visible state of the call prefix tree, except for the traversal options:

.TP
\fBOpen\fR
Open a STAT generated .dot file
.TP
\fBSave As\fR
Save the current graph in .dot format, which can be displayed by STATview or in .gif format which can be viewed on any computer with an image viewer
.TP
\fBUndo\fR
Undo the previous operation(s)
.TP
\fBRedo\fR
Redo the undone operation(s)
.TP
\fBOriginal Graph\fR
Revert to the original graph
.TP
\fBHide MPI\fR
Collapse the MPI implementation frames below the MPI function call
.TP
\fBTraverse\fR
Traverse the prefix tree by expanding the leaves to the next equivalence class set.  The first click will display the first equivalence class.
.TP
\fBFocus\fR
Only display call paths taken by the specified task
.TP
\fBLongest Path\fR
Traversal focus on the next longest call path(s).  The first click will focus on the longest path.
.TP
\fBShortest Path\fR
Traversal focus on the next shortest call path(s).  The first click will focus on the shortest path.
.TP
\fBSingle Task\fR
Focus on any path that leads to a leaf that was only visited by a single task
.TP
\fBIdentify Eq Classes\fR
Identify the equivalence classes, sets of tasks that have visited the same set of routines, of the visible graph
