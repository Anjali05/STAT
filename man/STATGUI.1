.SH NAME
STATGUI \- invoke the Stack Trace Analysis Tool GUI.
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBSTATGUI\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
STATGUI is a GUI that drives STAT, the Stack Trace Analysis Tool, and allows you to interactively control the sampling of stack traces from your parallel application.  STATGUI is built on STATview and provides the same call tree manipulation operations.  For more on these operations see \fBSTATview\fR\&.
.PP
In addition to the operations provided by STATview, STATGUI provides a toolbar  to control STAT's operation.
.TP
\fBAttach\fR
Attach to your parallel application and gather an initial sample.  
.TP
\fBReAttach\fR
Reattach to the previous parallel application and gather an initial sample.
.TP
\fBDetach\fR
Detach from your parallel application.
.TP
\fBPause\fR
Put the application in a stopped state.
.TP
\fBResume\fR
Set the application running.
.TP
\fBSample\fR
Gather and merge a single stack trace from each task in your parallel application.  The application is left in a stopped state upon sampling.
.TP
\fBSample Multiple\fR
Gather and merge multiple stack traces from each task in your parallel application over time.  The application is left in a stopped state upon sampling.
.PP
STATGUI can also serve as an interface to attach a full-featured debugger such as TotalView or DDT to a subset of application tasks.  This interface can be accessed through the "identify equivalence classes" \fBEq C\fR button, which will pop up the equivalence classes window .  You can then select a single representative, all, or none of an equivalence classes' tasks to form a subset of tasks. The \fBAttach to Subset\fR buttons will launch the specified debugger and attach to the subset of tasks (note, this detaches STAT from the application). The \fBDebugger Options\fR button allows you to modify the debugger path.
