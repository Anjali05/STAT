STAT (the Stack Trace Analysis Tool) is a highly scalable, lightweight tool that gathers and merges stack traces from all of the processes of a parallel application.  After running the STAT command, STAT will create a STAT_results directory in your current working directory.  This directory will contain a subdirectory, based on your parallel application's executable name, with the merged stack traces in DOT format.
