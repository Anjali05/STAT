<command>stat-script</command> is a Python interface for STAT. When invoked without any arguments, this will create an interactive Python environment with the appropriate paths set to import the <command>STAT</command> module. You can run <command>dir(STAT)</command> to see the available functions, flags, etc. running <command>help()</command> (i.e., <command>help(STAT.attach)</command>) will display the description of the function as well as the arguments required. Like the <command>python</command> command, <command>stat-script</command> can also be supplied with a python script file to execute. You may refer to examples/scripts/script_test.py in the STAT source or share/STAT/examples/bin/script_test.py in the installation directory for an example of how the stat scripting interface can be used.
