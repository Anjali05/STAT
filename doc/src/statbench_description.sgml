The Stack Trace Analysis Tool is a highly scalable, lightweight tool that gathers and merges stack traces from all of the processes of a parallel application.  <command>stat-bench</command> is a benchmark that can emulate STAT's performance.  By utilizing your entire parallel allocation (launching one stat-bench daemon emulator per core) and generating artificial stack traces, stat-bench is able model STAT's performance using less resources than an actual STAT run requires.  With various options, you can also map stat-bench to your target machine architecture and target application.  After completion, stat-bench will create a stat_results directory in your current working directory.  This directory will contain a subdirectory for the current run, with the merged stack traces in DOT format as well as a performance results text file.  <![%userguide[An example stat-bench generated prefix tree emulating 1M (1024*1024) tasks can be seen in <xref linkend="statbench_1m_3d">.]]>
