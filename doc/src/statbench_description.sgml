The Stack Trace Analysis Tool is a highly scalable, lightweight tool that gathers and merges stack traces from all of the processes of a parallel application.  STATBench is a benchmark that can emulate STAT's performance.  By utilizing your entire parallel allocation (launching one STATBench daemon emulator per core) and generating artificial stack traces, STATBench is able model STAT's performance using less resources than an actual STAT run requires.  With various options, you can also map STATBench to your target machine architecture and target application.  After completion, STATBench will create a STAT_results directory in your current working directory.  This directory will contain a subdirectory for the current run, with the merged stack traces in DOT format as well as a performance results text file.  <![%userguide[An example STATBench generated prefix tree emulating 1M (1024*1024) tasks can be seen in <xref linkend="statbench_1m_3d">.]]>
