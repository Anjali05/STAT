  <h2>Overview</h2>
The Stack Trace Analysis Tool (STAT) is a highly scalable, lightweight tool that gathers and merges stack traces from all of the processes of a parallel application to form call graph prefix trees.  STAT generates two prefix trees termed 2D-trace-space and 3D-trace-space-time.  The 2D-trace-space prefix tree is a merge of a single stack trace from each task in the parallel application.  The 3D-trace-space-time prefix tree is a merge of several stack traces from each task gathered over time.  The latter provides insight into whether tasks are making progress or are in a hang state (livelock, deadlock, infiite loop, etc.).  The call graph prefix trees also identify processes equivalence classes, processes exhibitin similar behavior with respect to their call paths.  A representative task from each equivalence class can then be fed into a full-featured debugger for root cause analysis at a manageable scale.

STAT's source code also includes STATBench, a tool to emulate STAT.  STATBench enables the benchmarking of STAT on arbitrary machine architectures and applications by fully utilizing parallel resources and generating artificial stack traces.
