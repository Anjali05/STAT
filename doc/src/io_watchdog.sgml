STAT can be used in conjunction with the <ulink url="http://code.google.com/p/io-watchdog/">IO Watchdog</ulink> utility, which monitors application output to detect hangs.  To enable STAT with the IO Watchdog, add the following to the file $HOME/.io-watchdogrc
</para>
<informalexample>
    <screen>
search /usr/local/tools/io-watchdog/actions
timeout = 20m
actions = STAT, kill
    </screen>
</informalexample>
<para>
You will then need to run your application with the --io-watchdog <command>srun</command> option:
</para>
<informalexample>
    <screen>
% srun --io-watchdog mpi_application    
    </screen>
</informalexample>
<para>
When STAT is invoked, it will create a STAT_results directory in the current working directory, as it would in a typical STAT run.  The outputted .dot files can then be viewed with <command>STATview</command>.  For more details about using IO Watchdog, refer to the IO Watchdog README file in /usr/local/tools/io-watchdog/README.
